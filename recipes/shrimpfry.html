        <h1>How to make a delicious Shrimp Fry!</h1>
        <img alt="Shrimp Fry" src="../images/shrimpfry.jpg">

        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Ebi Fry is a Japanese fried shrimp made with succulent shrimp coated with Panko breadcrumbs and fried till golden brown. The preparation is similar to Tonkatsu and Korokke.</p>

            <p>Ebi Fry is one of the most popular Yoshoku dishes. Y≈çshoku refers to a Japanese-style western dish, which originated during the Meiji Restoration between 1868 and early 1900.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 large shrimp, deveined, tails on</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 large egg, gently beaten</li>
                <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Clean shrimp: remove shells from shrimp without removing tails. (If shrimp have not been deveined, simply cut a slit on the back of the shrimp to remove the black innards, using a toothpick to lift vein out.)</li>
                <li>Make a few incisions on the stomach side of the shrimp and lightly press the back of the shrimp to straighten it out. This will prevent shrimp from curling when cooked.</li>
                <li>Pat shrimp dry using paper towels.</li>
                <li>Set up a work station with three shallow dishes: place flour in the first, beaten egg in the second, and panko breadcrumbs in the last dish. Be sure to add a touch of salt and black pepper to the flour, which helps to add flavor to the ebi fry.</li>
                <li>First, dust the shrimp in flour lightly.</li>
                <li>Then, dip the flour coated shrimp in the egg wash.</li>
                <li>Finally, place the shrimp in the panko dish and make sure that the shrimp is coated completely with panko bread crumbs.</li>
                <li>In a deep pan, heat oil to about 340 to 360 degrees F. Set up large plate or platter covered with paper towels to drain the shrimp after its been fried.</li>
                <li>Fry breaded shrimp until brown, turning over once, before moving shrimp to paper towel-covered plate to drain.</li>
